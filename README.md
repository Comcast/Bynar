# Bynar
<!--<img src="">-->
Warehouse scale server repair, more benign than borg.

----

Bynar is an open source system for automating server maintenance 
across the datacenter.  Bynar builds upon many years of experience 
automating the drudgery of server repair. The goal is to have the
datacenter maintain itself.  Large clusters these days require
lots of maintenance.  [Cassandra], [Ceph], [Gluster], [Hadoop] and others
all require quick replacement of server parts as they break down or the cluster
becomes degraded.  The problem is that as your cluster grows you generally need to have more
people to maintain them.  Bynar hopes to break this cycle and 
free your time up so your clusters can scale to ever greater sizes 
without requiring more people to maintain them.  

The project is divided into different binaries that all communicate over protobuf:
1. disk-manager: This program handles adding and removing of disks from a server
2. dead-disk-detector:  This program handles detection of failed hard drives, files a ticket 
for a datacenter technician to replace the drive, waits for resolution of the ticket and 
then makes an API call to `disk-manager` to add the new disk back into the server.
3. client: Enables you to manually make API calls against `disk-manager`
4. parallel-deploy: This is a tool to quickly deploy a cluster of ceph osds.

## To start using Bynar

### Configuration:
1. Create your configuration file.  The utility takes json config
information.  Edit the `/etc/bynar/config.json` file to configure it.
An optional proxy field can be configured to send JIRA REST API requests through.
Fields for this file are:
```
{
 "db_location": "/etc/bynar/disks.sqlite3",
 "proxy": "https://my.proxy",
 "manager_host": "localhost",
 "manager_port": 5555,
 "jira_user": "test_user",
 "jira_password": "user_password",
 "jira_host": "https://tickets.jira.com",
 "jira_ticket_assignee": "username",
 "jira_issue_type": "3",
 "jira_priority": "4",
 "jira_project_id": "MyProject",
 "jira_ticket_assignee": "assignee_username"
}
```
### Directory layout:
1. Top level is the dead disk detector
2. api is the protobuf api create
3. disk-manager is the service that handles adding and removing disks
4. client is the cli client to make RPC calls to disk manager or dead disk detector
5. parallel-deploy is a utility to quickly deploy a ceph osd cluster in parallel.  
Deploy 1000 osds in the time it takes to deploy 1 manually.

### Launch the program
1. After building bynar from source or downloading prebuilt packages
launch `disk-manager`, `dead-disk-detector` on every server you want 
maintained.
