2019 Roadmap

- Provide documentation on Bynar
   - What is bynar
   - What is NOT Bynar
   - Current release features and future release enhancements
   - Testing results of everything done (on the fence about this one, but for some folks could prove valuable?)
- Finish GlusterFS backend
   - This backend is just a stub at the moment
- Basic ScaleIO backend
- Openstack support
- Safe to add disk trait
  - Sometimes it's safe to remove a disk but not safe to add one.
- HP Raid controller support.  We've gotten far without needing this but eventually the time will come when bynar has to talk to the raid controller and change the configuration.
