2019 Roadmap

 - Finish GlusterFS backend
   - This backend is just a stub at the moment
 - Basic ScaleIO backend
 - Openstack support
 - Safe to add disk trait
   - Sometimes it's safe to remove a disk but not safe to add one.
 - HP Raid controller support.  We've gotten far without needing this but eventually the time will come when bynar has to talk to the raid controller and change the configuration.
