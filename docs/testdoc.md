# Bynar Test Document
## Setup Information and Prerequisites
Travis runs continuous integration on Pull Requests.  You will need Rust Nightly to run cargo test
## Test Cases
### Test Case 1: Bynar Configuration
##### Description
This case consists of the steps required to test Bynar's Config File  
##### Preconditions For Running the Test Case 
Root permissions are necessary when running these test cases as the test functions will attempt to create loopback devices, mount them, check their filesystems, etc.  The nightly compiler for Rust is also currently required for testing as Mocktopus currently uses features that are not yet in stable Rust.
